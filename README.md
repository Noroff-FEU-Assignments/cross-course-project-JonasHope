## Description

This is the very first project I had in my studies. I came back to this project many times over the first year, making the code a bit messy.
The site is a very simple version of an online rain jacket shop. It was originally made without javascript with dummy links etc. 
In the end we added some simple javascript for the shop function and form validations.
